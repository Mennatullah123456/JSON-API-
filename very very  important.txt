Dear HR Manger
how are you todayðŸ˜€

The following is information about the task and the steps that I have taken
I have completed the application required of me as I understood from the data included

In fact, I was confused!
  Do I do Todo, from the beginning, or do I use the api as you sent links to it? 
Also, I did not understand well. Is it required in this task that I do all the work, such as delete update remove on the api, or do all of this from the beginning.
So I made both. The first part is a complete todo list independent of the API part
And in the API part, I just made fetch for the API using the javascript fetch function with Bootstrap
